           	    <h2>Literature Survey</h2>
				
				<div align="justify"> <p> Organizational innovation adoption   has received increasing attention in the marketing and management literature over the past two decades.  This implicates that, organizations are experiencing high levels of regulating influences are more likely to adopt and use web service technologies. The benefits of web services are inter operatability between various software applications running on desperate platforms, accelerated application development, increase worker productivity, and improved employee and customer satisfaction.<p/>
				<br/>
 <p> Literature is included with so many definitions for Cloud computing.  Cloud computing is basically a style or concept of computing in which massively scalable IT-related capabilities are provided “as a service”.  It uses the power and dynamics of internet technologies to service multiple external customers.<p/><br/>
<p> Cloud Computing is one of the major web service trend in Information Technology phenomenon.  Cloud computing can be defined as a new style of computing in which dynamically scalable and often virtualized resources are provided as a services over the Internet.  In the near future, Cloud Computing can be emerged in various directions.<p/><br/> 

<p> Cloud computing can be presented using a layered architecture.   Basically this architecture illustrates the types of cloud computing services.   There are three main types of cloud services:  Software as a Service (SaaS),   Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). There are two other services provided by cloud computing technology, data-Storage-as-a-Service (dSaaS), and Hardware-as-a-Service (HaaS). The next most important categorization in cloud computing are the types of cloud computing. There are three types of cloud computing, private cloud, public cloud and hybrid cloud.<p/>

				<h2>Research Gap and Problem </h2>
				<div align="justify"> <p> Past researches haven‟t contributed to identify an appropriate model to suit the developing countries especially Sri Lanka regarding the adoption of cloud computing. This research gap postulates to identify the focus area of research. In the previous researches the research gap is identified that organization are lacking in adoption of cloud computing because of less technological understanding and less infrastructure development. The research team has identified the research question according to the above research gap. To fulfill the gap the team has reviewed previous researches and identified the influencing factors. This factors are now been confirmed using case studies from different organizations in Sri Lanka. The research was to cover three sub objectives to fulfill the research gap. First one is to elaborate the technological factors, organizational and environmental factors how they influence for an effective adoption of cloud computing in developing countries like Sri Lanka. Finally the research covers the behavior of organizational factors andtechnological factors and leave environmental factor as a future progres.<p/>
